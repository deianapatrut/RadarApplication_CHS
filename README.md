Radar application using an ultrasonic sensor, a servomotor and a graphical interface:

Our radar aplication measure a distance between 10 cm and 100 cm that is permanently calculated by an ultra-sonic sensor. The sensor is rotating around his rotational axis in order to have an agle of visibility around 160â—¦. In order to complete the rotation around the axis, we use a servo-motor that is controlled by an Arduino
board.
